					<p>
						â€” are very much welcome during the Buddhism and
						reception ceremonies, however they are going to be separated in an exclusive area for kids - <em>Kalinaw
							Hall</em> in
						the church and <em>bride's make up room in Cove</em>. Parents are encouraged to let them bring their <em>own
							toys and
							other
							essentials </em>that would last them all throughout the day. They are placed under the supervision of
						adults who
						are
						assigned for this task, so there's nothing to worry about. This is initiated so that the guests can focus on
						the ceremonies while the kids will have their own way of enjoying the day.

				<div class="reminder">
					<span class="heading">PROGRAM NOTICE</span>
					<p>
						During the reception program, the couple would like to do away with the usual money dance for the guests.
						Instead, they would like to have the money dare.
					</p>
					<span class="sub">Mechanics:</span>
					<p>
						All guests assigned in tables 1 to 9 will hold their money as one and will think of one dare
						for the couple to do in exchange for the money you have gathered in your table. So every table is encouraged
						to have a <em>fun dare</em> for the couple. The table with the <em>highest amount</em> will receive a prize from the couple.
					</p>
					<span class="sub">Ex:</span>
					<p>For 10,000 pesos, we dare the couple to do a 5-second kiss.</p>
